[BARE][bare] (Binary Application Record Encoding) is a schema-based binary format that favors compactness and simplicity.
[bare-ts/lib](#) provides decoders and encoders for basic BARE types.

Please, take a look to [bare-ts/bare][bare-ts-bare] for more information.

Warning: BARE specification is currently a IEF draft.
The specification is likely to evolve before its final release.
However, most of the changes since the beginning concern the schema language.
The binary format is fairly stable.
